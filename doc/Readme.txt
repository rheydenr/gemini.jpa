This release provides you with access to the EclipseLink JPA 2.0 provider. The 
bundles in the EclipseLink 2.4.0 release or later should be used.

For an example of how to access an EntityManager from an OSGi program see the 
sample bundles (e.g. org.eclipse.gemini.jpa.sample.basic).
To do this, install and start the bundles described in "GettingStarted.txt" (included in this 
distribution). 

This release is only for migration to Java 11. No other bugs are fixed.
